## Project Description

Song recommender that takes an input and recommends a similar song from a list of over 10.000 songs.


## Workflow

My first step was to plan when I wanted to be finished with which part of the project. After deciding my deadlines I started
a list of steps I would have to follow for the game as a rough overview. I also noted some challenges where I could run into
difficulties and additional functions for my game. I save my project in a designated project folder in my working directory, work
on the files with Jupyter Notebooks and upload the changes on github.
